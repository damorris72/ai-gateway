# AI IQ Increaser â€“ Project Notes ðŸš€

## Project Overview
AI IQ Increaser is an AI-powered brain training app that helps users boost memory, logic, and reasoning skills with adaptive challenges.

## Development Journey (from chat log)
- Started as **AI Gateway** concept â†’ pivoted into **AI IQ Increaser**.
- Created multiple iterations of app structure & branding.
- Decided on **Next.js frontend** for cross-platform support (web, iOS/Android via wrappers).
- Fixed Vercel deployment errors by restructuring repo (`frontend` root, `vercel.json` config).

## Branding
- Logo: Futuristic brain + circuits with cosmic background.
- Colors: Deep Blue (#0B3D91), Neon Green (#00FF9C), White/Gray for accents.
- Tagline: *Unlock your mindâ€™s full potential.*

## Core Features Planned
1. **Onboarding** â€“ AI personalizes training path.
2. **Dashboard** â€“ Daily challenge button, progress tracker, streaks.
3. **Training Modules** â€“ Logic puzzles, memory games, focus tasks.
4. **Progress Analytics** â€“ IQ growth chart, strengths/weakness breakdown, AI recommendations.
5. **Social & Gamification** â€“ Leaderboards, shareable results, achievements.

## Monetization Ideas
- Freemium model (free daily challenge + paid premium features).
- Premium ($4.99/mo), Pro ($9.99/mo), Team packages for schools/workplaces.

## Growth Strategy
- Viral sharing of IQ results on social media.
- Daily push notifications to increase retention.
- Partnerships with productivity influencers.

## Technical Notes
- Built with **Next.js 14**, **React 18**.
- API test route `/api/hello` returns `"Hello from AI IQ Increaser API ðŸš€"`.
- Deployment via **Vercel** with proper root directory config.
- GitHub repo structure documented for clean CI/CD.

## Next Steps
- Finalize mockups for onboarding & dashboard screens.
- Expand training module designs (logic, memory, focus).
- Add AI personalization logic (track weak spots, adapt difficulty).
- Wrap into iOS/Android app once web app stable.
